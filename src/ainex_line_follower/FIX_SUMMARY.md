# SUMMARY OF FIXES

## Problems Identified

### 1. Robot Head Looking Upward
- The robot's head was constantly pointing straight up instead of looking at the ground
- This prevented the camera from seeing the line path

### 2. No Debug Image in RViz
- The topic `/line_follower_node/debug_image` wasn't showing images
- Camera images weren't being processed

### 3. No Line Detected Warning
- Constant warnings: "No line detected!"
- This was due to the camera not being oriented correctly

---

## Root Causes

### Camera Orientation Issue
**File**: `ainex_simulations/ainex_description/urdf/gazebo.xacro`
- Camera sensor pose was set to extreme angles: `<pose>0 0 0 ${M_PI} -${M_PI/2} -${M_PI/2}</pose>`
- This caused: Roll=180°, Pitch=-90°, Yaw=-90°
- Camera was looking sideways/upward instead of at the ground

### Missing Head Controller Initialization
**File**: `ainex_line_follower/scripts/line_follower_node.py`
- `head_pan` and `head_tilt` controllers were not included in the joint publisher setup
- No initial position was set for the head joints
- Robot defaulted to looking straight up

---

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Updated Camera Sensor Orientation
**File**: `src/ainex_simulations/ainex_description/urdf/gazebo.xacro` (Line 38-41)

**Changed**:
```xml
<!-- BEFORE: Extreme rotations -->
<pose>0 0 0 ${M_PI} -${M_PI/2} -${M_PI/2}</pose>

<!-- AFTER: 30-degree downward tilt -->
<pose>0 0 0 0 0.523599 0</pose>
```

**Result**: Camera now points downward at 30° to see the ground and line path.

### ✅ Fix 2: Added Head Controllers to Line Follower Node
**File**: `src/ainex_line_follower/scripts/line_follower_node.py` (Line 134-138)

**Changed**:
```python
# BEFORE: Only leg and arm joints
joints = [
    'l_hip_yaw', 'l_hip_roll', 'l_hip_pitch', 'l_knee', 'l_ank_pitch', 'l_ank_roll',
    'r_hip_yaw', 'r_hip_roll', 'r_hip_pitch', 'r_knee', 'r_ank_pitch', 'r_ank_roll',
    'l_sho_pitch', 'r_sho_pitch'
]

# AFTER: Added head controllers
joints = [
    'l_hip_yaw', 'l_hip_roll', 'l_hip_pitch', 'l_knee', 'l_ank_pitch', 'l_ank_roll',
    'r_hip_yaw', 'r_hip_roll', 'r_hip_pitch', 'r_knee', 'r_ank_pitch', 'r_ank_roll',
    'l_sho_pitch', 'r_sho_pitch',
    'head_pan', 'head_tilt'  # <-- ADDED
]
```

**Result**: Head controllers are now properly initialized and controlled.

### ✅ Fix 3: Set Initial Head Position
**File**: `src/ainex_line_follower/scripts/line_follower_node.py` (Line 153-168)

**Changed**:
```python
# BEFORE: No head position initialization
init_positions = {
    'l_hip_yaw': 0.0,
    # ... other joints ...
    'l_sho_pitch': 0.0,
    'r_sho_pitch': 0.0,
}

# AFTER: Head positioned to look at ground
init_positions = {
    'l_hip_yaw': 0.0,
    # ... other joints ...
    'l_sho_pitch': 0.0,
    'r_sho_pitch': 0.0,
    'head_pan': 0.0,        # Center (no left/right rotation)
    'head_tilt': 0.5,       # Tilt down ~28.6° to look at ground
}
```

**Result**: Robot's head now tilts downward on startup to look at the line path.

1. **`src/ainex_line_follower/scripts/line_follower_node.py`**
   - Line 134-138: Added head_pan and head_tilt to joint publishers
   - Line 153-168: Added initial head positions (head_tilt=0.5 rad)

2. **`src/ainex_simulations/ainex_description/urdf/gazebo.xacro`**
   - Line 41: Changed camera pose from extreme angles to 30° downward pitch

3. **New Files Created**:
   - `FIXES.md` - Detailed documentation of fixes
   - `check_fixes.sh` - Automated verification script

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Rebuild the Workspace
```bash
cd ~/competition_ws
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
```

### Step 2: Launch the Simulation
```bash
roslaunch ainex_line_follower line_follower_simulation.launch
```

### Step 3: Verify Camera View
In a new terminal:
```bash
# View camera feed to confirm downward orientation
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw

# View debug image with line detection overlay
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/line_follower_node/debug_image
```

### Step 4: Check Line Detection
```bash
# Should now show "true" when line is visible
rostopic echo /line_follower_node/line_detected
```

### Step 5: Run Verification Script
```bash
cd ~/competition_ws/src/ainex_line_follower
./check_fixes.sh
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### ✅ Robot Appearance
- Head tilted downward naturally
- Not looking straight up anymore
- Realistic humanoid posture

### ✅ Camera View
- Ground plane visible in camera feed
- Black line visible in center/lower portion of image
- Proper perspective for line following

### ✅ Line Detection
- Debug image shows:
  - ✓ Green rectangles (ROI regions)
  - ✓ Red contours (detected black line)
  - ✓ Blue circle (line center point)
  - ✓ Yellow vertical line (image center)
  - ✓ Status text showing "Line Detected: YES"

### ✅ Console Output
```
[INFO] Setting initial walking pose...
[INFO] Initial pose set
[INFO] Line Follower Node initialized successfully
[INFO] Line follower node running...
[INFO] Following line - X: 80, Yaw: -2.50°  # <-- Should see this instead of warnings
```

## Viewing Debug Image in RViz

1. Launch RViz:
   ```bash
   rosrun rviz rviz
   ```

2. Add Image Display:
   - Click **Add** button (bottom left)
   - Go to **By topic** tab
   - Expand `/line_follower_node`
   - Select `/debug_image` → **Image**
   - Click **OK**

3. Configure Display:
   - Set **Image Topic**: `/line_follower_node/debug_image`
   - The image should appear in the RViz viewport

---

## Troubleshooting

### If camera still looks wrong:
1. Verify Gazebo is running
2. Check camera topic is publishing:
   ```bash
   rostopic hz /camera/rgb/image_raw
   ```
3. Manually adjust head tilt:
   ```bash
   rostopic pub /head_tilt_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 0.5"
   ```

### If no line detected:
1. Check camera view shows the ground
2. Verify ground plane texture is loaded
3. Adjust HSV thresholds in `config/line_follower_params.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   lower_black: [0, 0, 0]
   upper_black: [180, 255, 50]  # Increase V value if needed
   ```

### If debug image is blank:
1. Ensure line_follower_node is running
2. Check image topic exists:
   ```bash
   rostopic list | grep debug_image
   ```
3. Verify subscribers:
   ```bash
   rostopic info /line_follower_node/debug_image
   ```
