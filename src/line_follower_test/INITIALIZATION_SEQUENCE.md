# Rectangle Walker - Initialization Sequence

## Problem
Robot was starting to walk immediately after launch, before:
- Gazebo physics had stabilized
- Robot model was fully loaded
- Controllers were ready

This caused unstable initial steps and potential falling.

## Solution - Multi-Stage Initialization

### Stage 1: Spawn Stabilization (3 seconds)
```python
rospy.sleep(3.0)  # Wait for Gazebo physics to settle
```
- Allows robot to fully spawn in simulation
- Physics engine stabilizes
- All joints reach initial positions

### Stage 2: Walk Ready Action (2 seconds)
```python
motion_manager.run_action('walk_ready')
rospy.sleep(2.0)  # Wait for action to complete
```
- Executes predefined 'walk_ready' stance (from Reference code)
- Sets proper joint angles for stable walking
- Ensures robot is balanced before first step

### Stage 3: Final Countdown (2 seconds)
```python
rospy.sleep(2.0)  # Final countdown before starting
```
- Visual confirmation period
- Allows user to observe ready state
- System message: "Starting rectangle walk in 2 seconds..."

### Stage 4: Mission Start
- Begin rectangle walking pattern
- All systems initialized and stable

## Total Initialization Time
**7 seconds** from node start to first walking step:
- 3s: Physics stabilization
- 2s: Walk ready action
- 2s: Final countdown

## Fallback Handling
If `motion_manager` is not available (simulation mode):
```python
except Exception as e:
    rospy.logwarn(f"Motion manager not available, using direct pose: {e}")
    self.gait_manager.update_pose(self.go_gait_param)
    rospy.sleep(2.0)
```

## Log Output Example
```
‚è≥ Waiting for robot to spawn and stabilize...
ü§ñ Executing walk_ready action...
‚úÖ Walk ready action completed!
üé¨ Starting rectangle walk in 2 seconds...
‚úÖ Robot initialized and ready to walk!

============================================================
üéØ MISSION PARAMETERS
============================================================
   Number of laps: 2
   Rectangle size: 30.0cm x 20.0cm
   Perimeter: 100.0cm per lap
   Forward speed: 10.0mm per step
   Turn speed: 6¬∞ per step
============================================================
```

## Reference Implementation
Based on proven pattern from:
- `Reference/ainex_example/scripts/visual_patrol/visual_patrol_node.py`
- `Reference/ainex_example/scripts/combination/combination_node.py`

All Reference nodes use:
```python
self.motion_manager.run_action('walk_ready')
```

## Benefits
‚úÖ **Stable start**: No jerky initial movements
‚úÖ **Proper balance**: Robot in correct stance before walking
‚úÖ **Predictable timing**: Consistent initialization across runs
‚úÖ **User feedback**: Clear log messages at each stage
‚úÖ **Gazebo compatibility**: Extra time for simulation physics
